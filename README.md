## Project Overview
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a computational method that is commonly used by researchers and scientists to determine whether there is an association between a set of genes and disease phenotype [1]. GSEA-P, GSEApy, and fGSEA are all different GSEA implementations. Recently, a group of researchers at Ma’ayan Labs developed blitzGSEA. The algorithm is claimed to have “significant improvement in performance.” [2] Thus, before implementing blitzGSEA into Xena for users to run, the results produced must be confirmed to make biological sense, and the runtime and memory usage of the algorithm is established to be efficient.
